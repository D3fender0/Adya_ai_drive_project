## âœ… Functional Testing

   I performed manual testing by providing different types of inputs to observe how the chatbot responds.

   I also used the Botium tool for some test cases.

   I focused on verifying the chatbotâ€™s interaction flow and accessibility.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Testing

  I used LambdaTest to check the chatbotâ€™s multi-device responsiveness.

   Some test cases were also tested manually to ensure a smooth user experience.

## ðŸ“ˆ Load Testing

  I used Apache JMeter to simulate multiple users (50 to 100 users) interacting with the chatbot simultaneously.

 This helped evaluate the chatbotâ€™s performance under heavy load.

## ðŸ”— API Testing

  I validated the chatbotâ€™s API requests and responses using Postman.

  The focus was on ensuring correct data transmission and error handling.

## ðŸ”’ Security Testing

   I tested different payloads to check input validation and injection resistance.

  I also attempted prompt engineering techniques to misuse or manipulate the chatbot's responses, helping to identify vulnerabilities.
